#Define your own groups here and assign creatures to your groups. There are default groups for all biomes, which do not have to be created by you, unless you want to assign different creatures to it.
# Special groups: all, creature, boss
groups:
    My Plains Group:
        - Deathsquito
        - Fuling Berserker
    My Bosses:
        - The Elder
        - Bonemass
        - Moder

#Set the level up chances for each of your groups here. Start with world level 0 and define the different chances in percent from left to right, starting with 1 star.
# This will set the level up chances for the Meadows biome und will also disable the Armored effect and the Chaos infusion until you reach world level 2 in this biome.
