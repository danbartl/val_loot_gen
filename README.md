This is a set of R scripts to:
    - read a CLLC YAML file (currently only HP, damage, attack speed and movement speed are considered and ONLY from the YAML (not from config))
    - read creature basic data (configurable to add other e.g. RRR NPCS) bosses are not yet fully implemented
    - specify maximum loot for strongest enemy
    - generate full distribution of drops and loot (currently following EpicLoot "crafting approach" to only specify enchanting materials)
    - generate loottables.json that can be copied for use in Epi Loot (currently only creatures)
